# Perform dependency check using Aqua Trivy

  The trivy_fs_scan stage in the CI/CD pipeline is designed to perform a file system security scan using Trivy, a vulnerability scanner. This section in the build stage,specifies that the trivy_fs_scan job belongs to the security stage of your pipeline. The security stage is dedicated to tasks related to scanning and analyzing security vulnerabilities.The script section contains the commands that will be executed during this stage.
  trivy fs --format table -o fs.html .: This command runs Trivy to scan the file system for vulnerabilities.
  trivy fs: Invokes Trivy to perform a file system scan.
--format table: Specifies the output format of the scan results. In this case, the results will be displayed in a table format.
-o fs.html: Directs Trivy to save the scan results to a file named fs.html in HTML format. This allows for easy viewing and sharing of the scan results.
.: Indicates the current directory as the target for the scan. Trivy will scan the entire file system starting from this directory

# Perform SonarQube for quality check and code coverage

  For sonarqube,the first thing to do since docker is already installed on the terminal through the pipeline is to run this command: `Docker run -d -p   9000:9000 nsonarqube:lts-community.
  The docker run: Starts a new Docker container.
  -d: Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
  -p 9000:9000: Maps port 9000 of the container to port 9000 on your host machine, making SonarQube accessible at http://localhost:9000.
  sonarqube:lts-community: Specifies the Docker image and tag for SonarQubeâ€™s LTS Community Edition.

 To access SonarQube, copy the IP address of the EC2 instance (named corporate-dev) from AWS, paste it into your browser, and append the port 9000. SonarQube will start, and you'll be able to configure it so that reports can be pushed to the SonarQube server through the pipeline.
  Configuration Steps;
    - Log In: Access SonarQube and log in with the username admin and password admin. Change the password to something secure.
    - Setup Integration with GitLab:
    - Go to the SonarQube settings.
    - Choose the GitLab option.
    - Enter a configuration name of your choice.
    - For GitLab API URL, use: https://gitlab.com/api/v4.
    - Generate a Personal Access Token:
    - Navigate to GitLab, then go to Settings > Access Tokens.
    - Click on Add New Token.
    - Provide a name for the token.
    - Select the Reporter role under Scopes (or choose scopes based on your requirements).
    - Copy the generated token and paste it into the SonarQube configuration for the Personal Access Token.
    
  After configuration,it will prmpt options to analyze your project,i used the Gitlab CI.Create a sonar.project.properties and add the provided command on the file.
  <img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-18 at 21 07 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e172ef2-240f-4856-adba-628cc2eb025e">.

  The next step is to add environment variables by creating two tokens.The first SonarQube Token and SOnarQube Host Url.Uncheck the protect variable ehile this is been created.
  This will automatically generate the code for the sonarqube build stage as seen below;

# Build the Docker image of the application using Docker

 In this stage, we will create a script for logging in by using Docker credentials. Instead of hardcoding these credentials directly into the script, we will define them as environment variables for security reasons.

 To do this:

Navigate to Settings > CI/CD in your project.
Add the necessary variables (e.g., DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD) with their respective values (username and password).
This approach ensures that sensitive information is securely managed.
Include mvn package in the script,because the artifcate might not be available to docker
Run the command:Docker build  `-t` for taging (your username) and tag- This is show below for understanding.
Finally Pushing the image

#  Scan the Docker image using Aqua Trivy for any vulnerability

  In this stage, I set up a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster using two Ubuntu virtual machines on AWS, named k8-master and k8-slave. After launching the   instances,i connected via Tabby terminal, update the packages with sudo apt update, and install Kubernetes components (kubectl, kubelet, kubeadm) on all   nodes.Setting up a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster allows for managing containerized applications across multiple nodes. kubectl, kubelet, and kubeadm are   essential tools for managing and maintaining the cluster.

  First, create a file with any name (e.g., 1.sh), make it executable, and paste the commands for downloading kubectl, kubelet, and kubeadm obtained from the   Kubernetes documentation website.See image below;

<img width="798" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-18 at 21 46 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc4119ef-cc1d-49bb-b42b-ee24cc099d0e">

Additionally, to connect the slave machine to the master node, run the command `sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 on the master node`. This command initializes the Kubernetes cluster and generates a token used for authenticating the connection of the slave machine to the master node.

Next step,is to create a directory on the `.kube` folder
change permission: `sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config`
To change ownership: `sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME /.kube/config`

Finally, convert the kubeconfig file into a Base64-encoded format. Use the cat kubeconfig command to display its contents, then paste the output into the `echo -n ''` command and run it.

#  Use YAML manifest files to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster

In the final stage, go to the CI/CD settings, navigate to the build stage, and create a kubeconfig path. Create a folder and add a variable named KUBECONFIG_CONTENT. Copy the content of the kubeconfig file from the terminal and paste it into the GitLab build section under this variable.Replace docker image to the docker image created.
